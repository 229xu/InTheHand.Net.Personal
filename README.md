InTheHand.Net.Personal
======================

A subset of the source code for the 32feet.NET Personal Area Networking library. 
Don't use the code from this repo! Instead, grab the official source from http://32feet.codeplex.com

If you insist on using the code from this repo, you should know that it is:
* Copyright © In The Hand Ltd 2003-2012
* Licensed under the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)

Note: The strong-name key in the project folder is not the original. I have generated a new stong-name key (and changed the assembly GUID) to help prevent conflicts with the official binaries.
